🧭 Task Manager – React.js, JSX, and CSS Front-End Development
📘 Overview

This project is a Task Manager Application built using React.js and Tailwind CSS as part of the PLP MERN Stack Development course module: React JS, JSX, and CSS — Mastering Front-End Development.

It demonstrates the use of reusable components, props, state management, routing, and API data fetching in a clean, modern UI.

🚀 Features

🧩 Reusable Components – Modular components like Button, TaskManager, and ApiData.

🎨 Tailwind CSS Integration – Clean, responsive styling without custom CSS files.

🔄 React Router – Multi-page navigation between Home, Tasks, and API Data pages.

🌐 API Fetching – Fetches data from an external API and displays it dynamically.

🧠 JSX Mastery – Proper use of props, conditional rendering, and reusable layouts.
